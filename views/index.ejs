            <h2>Getting Started ðŸ‘§</h2>
            <p>I have a degree in bachelor of technology with applied statistics. After my graduation i was interested in web development 
                and i started learning python through online platforms such as youtube.After a while i met a friend who recommended to me a Full-stack
                web development course on udemy.Since i had shown my interest, he offered to pay for it because he had started the same way and 
                managed to build a great profile for himself while still in campus.I gave it a short and after 5 months of studying, i completed 
                the syllabus. I tried searching for a job but i was not confident in myself,so the imposter syndrome won.I got myself a job at a 
                fruit and vegetable company offering quality control services.After nine months i could not bear working there anymore and i decided 
                to quit.Finally, here I am refreshing my knowledge on what i had learned to help me secure a job for myself as a web developer.
